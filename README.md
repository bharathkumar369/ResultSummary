### What I learned

I have brushup 'HTML' and 'CSS' skills with this project.
I have learned how to use REACT Hooks(useState, useEffect) to load data (especially
with useEffect) and can use the data even if data changes later.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
React.useEffect(()=>{
    setData(jsondata)
  },[data])
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

I brushup my knowledge using "https://www.w3schools.com/" site which helped me 
to finish my project.
